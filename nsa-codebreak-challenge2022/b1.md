# Task B1 - Information Gathering - (Reverse Engineering, Web Analysis)Points: 10

## Problem statement

>The attacker left a file with a ransom demand, which points to a site where they're demanding payment to release the victim's files.
> We suspect that the attacker may not have been acting entirely on their own. There may be a connection between the attacker and a larger ransomware-as-a-service ring.
> Analyze the demand site, and see if you can find a connection to another ransomware-related site.
> Enter the domain name of the associated site.
