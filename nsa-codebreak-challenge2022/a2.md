# Task A2 - Identifying the attacker - (Computer Forensics, Packet Analysis)Points: 40

## Problem statement

> Using the timestamp and IP address information from the VPN log, the FBI was able to identify a virtual server that the attacker used for staging their attack. They were able to obtain a warrant to search the server, but key files used in the attack were deleted.
> Luckily, the company uses an intrusion detection system which stores packet logs. They were able to find an SSL session going to the staging server, and believe it may have been the attacker transferring over their tools.
> The FBI hopes that these tools may provide a clue to the attacker's identity
> What was the username of the account the attacker used when they built their tools?
