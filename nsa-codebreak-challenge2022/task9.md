# Task 9 - The End of the Road - (Cryptanalysis, Software Development)Points: 5000

## Problem statement

> Unfortunately, looks like the ransomware site suffered some data loss, and doesn't have the victim's key to give back! I guess they weren't planning on returning the victims' files, even if they paid up.
> There's one last shred of hope: your cryptanalysis skills. We've given you one of the encrypted files from the victim's system, which contains an important message. Find the encryption key, and recover the message.
> Enter the value recovered from the file
