# Task B2 - Getting Deeper - (Web Hacking, [redacted])Points: 100

## Problem statement

> It looks like the backend site you discovered has some security features to prevent you from snooping. They must have hidden the login page away somewhere hard to guess.
> Analyze the backend site, and find the URL to the login page.
> Hint: this group seems a bit sloppy. They might be exposing more than they intend to.
> Warning: Forced-browsing tools, such as DirBuster, are unlikely to be very helpful for this challenge, and may get your IP address automatically blocked by AWS as a DDoS-prevention measure. Codebreaker has no control over this blocking, so we suggest not attempting to use these techniques.
> Enter the URL for the login page
